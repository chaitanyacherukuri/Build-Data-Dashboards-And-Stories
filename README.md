In this project, I created visualizations using Tableau and wrote a report to reveal insights from a data set of flight delays and cancellations. This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 
The Project report includes the following sections:
1. Links to my worksheet, dashboard and story
2. Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
3. Design: explained the design choices I made in creating visualizations
